Hello, I'm Ihtesham Haider,
I'm a developer + writer. I'm really grateful to be the part of this community.
I'm a web developer HTML/CSS/JAVASCRIPT and PYTHON developer.

I just dive in mobile developement with dart/flutter. I choose dart because their developer company is not a small company. Dart is created by GOOGLE as well as flutter.
I like react.js & react native.

I'm learning and developing skills how to make things simple and easy not only for myself but for others?
I'm reading others code and finding the hardness in it and then produce it in a simple manner. So you can see how they actually should be.

thanks for visiting
